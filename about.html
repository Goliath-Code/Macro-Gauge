        <h2>About the App</h2>

        <!-- <h3>About the app?</h3> -->
        <p>The app is designed for people with the ability to work from home and may also be useful for personal trainers to advise their clients on nutrition on a basic level. If you workout with a laptop or desktop nearby it can be a useful motivator to see your goals displayed in simple terms on screen with it having to look like a spread sheet. At the end of a four to six week workout program it can be motivating to see the numbers and keep records over time. This is why we have have included the PDF button, you can save it as a file to your PC and/ or print it all out and keep a physical copy to look back on at the end of the year to see your progress.</p>

        <p>Below all of the sliders you also have a row of inputs labeled "CURRENT" and the row below that labeled "Target". Above each pair is a title such as "Weight in KG" for example. The Weight slider will fill in the current input, but you will need to add your target weight in kg below that. On the main screen when you close the hatch on the top left you will see a title of "Weight". Beside that title will be the difference between your current weight and your goal weight. The fields next three goals will appear beside the "Weight" title. In the center of the closed hatch you have your daily calories in large letters then the macro ranges displayed below that again in smaller print. This is to help keep your mind on the goal of you're working out from home without the motivation that seeing other gym goers may give you. Any little thing that helps with motivation is always a plus in my experience to help keep the motivation level up.</p>

        <h3>What is it for?</h3>
        <p>When you open the app at first there will be no numbers on screen. They will appear when you click the open button and then enter your weight, height, age using the provided sliders then choosing your sex prior to saving your record. After you fill out the required information you will see on the top left, a display for your recommended daily calories. To the right you will then see protein, carbs and fat which show number ranging from one to the other. These ranges are based on your chosen activity level primarily but are also influence by other metrics entered. </p>
        
        





        


        <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
        <p>It is mainly designed with people who workout from home and use a PC while training , but not limited to people in that position as personal trainers can use it for clients and if you use a gym and you're your own personal trainer it can be useful to have something automatically calculate your macros and calories just be using a couple of easy to use sliders.</p>


        <!-- <h2>Macro Nutrients explained</h2> -->
        <h3>Protein</h3>
        <p>Proteins are crucial macromolecules that play a fundamental role in the context of fitness and overall health. They are composed of amino acids, which are the building blocks of life, and they serve a myriad of essential functions in the human body. In the realm of fitness, proteins are vital for several reasons. Firstly, they are responsible for muscle development and repair. When you engage in physical activities like weightlifting or endurance training, tiny muscle fibers get damaged, and proteins step in to mend and strengthen these fibers, making your muscles larger and more resilient. Additionally, proteins are indispensable for maintaining a balanced metabolism and promoting fat loss while preserving lean muscle mass. This is because they help control hunger and regulate blood sugar levels, making it easier to manage body composition. Overall, proteins are the cornerstone of fitness, aiding in muscle growth, recovery, and maintaining a healthy body composition.</p>
        
        <h3>Carbs (Carbohydrates)</h3>
        <p>Carbohydrates are vital macronutrients with significant importance in the context of fitness and overall well-being. They are the body's primary source of energy, providing fuel for physical activities, from high-intensity workouts to everyday activities. Carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which powers your muscles and brain. For fitness enthusiasts, they are especially important for sustaining endurance during prolonged exercise and enhancing performance in activities such as running, cycling, and various sports. Additionally, carbs aid in post-workout recovery by replenishing glycogen stores in your muscles, reducing muscle fatigue, and facilitating muscle repair. Therefore, carbohydrates are an essential component of a well-balanced diet for those pursuing fitness goals, as they play a critical role in providing the energy and recovery needed to excel in physical activities.</p>
    
        <h3>Fats (Lipids, LDL vs HDL)</h3>
        <p>Fats, or lipids, are crucial macronutrients with significant importance in the context of fitness and overall health. While proteins and carbohydrates are often in the spotlight when it comes to fitness, fats play a distinct and indispensable role. Fats are a concentrated source of energy, and they serve as a long-term fuel reserve for your body, making them essential for endurance activities. In fitness, they help support various bodily functions, including hormone production, which is vital for muscle growth and overall well-being. Moreover, fats are essential for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), which are crucial for maintaining overall health.</p>

        <p>Now, to differentiate between HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) and LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein), these are two types of cholesterol in your blood. HDL cholesterol is often referred to as "good" cholesterol because it helps remove excess cholesterol from your blood vessels, reducing the risk of plaque buildup and heart disease. On the other hand, LDL cholesterol, known as "bad" cholesterol, can accumulate in your arteries, forming plaques that can restrict blood flow and increase the risk of heart disease. In summary, HDL cholesterol is beneficial and protective, while LDL cholesterol can be detrimental when present in excessive amounts, making it crucial to maintain a balance between these two types of cholesterol for heart health.</p>

        <h3>What is BMI?</h3>
        <p>Body Mass Index is widely used to gauge if a persons weight is healthy for their height. There are five levels that go from underweight to extremely obese. Below you'll see the name of the range and the associated number and colours. This can be helpful if you find that you are over or under weight and wish to improve your health. The thing to be aware of is that since BMI only require height and weight you could well be a lean body builder and according to the BMI chart you could be considered overweight or obese. Its important to take your life style into considerationand how you appear to be also as far as body composition is concerned. If you are trying to lose or gain weight a body composition monitor is great for that use case if you need more than what BMI has to offer. </p>
